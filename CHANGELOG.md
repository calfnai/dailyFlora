# DailyFlora Changelog

## 0.12.0 - 2026-06-25

Current dense revision.

- Calendar button now opens a date picker instead of silently returning to today.
- Hover/title text now exposes the bouquet Chinese and English names.
- Random button now jumps to a random 2026 date and its date-seeded bouquet page.
- Camera route button now randomizes route behavior instead of only flipping left/right.
- Render levels now mean shape detail:
  - `省`: low-cost small solids, acceptable as simplified flower masses.
  - `清`: soft low-poly small flowers, still intentionally approximate.
  - `精`: mixed flower forms with varied size, cup/star/disc-like silhouettes, and more varied orientations.
- Green material is no longer only one repeated leaf shape; it now includes leaf, grass, rounded, and split botanical forms.
- Flower instances no longer all face the same direction.

Main files deciding the visual result:

- `src/bouquetScene.ts`
- `src/main.ts`
- `index.html`
- `src/styles.css`
